Revision history for App-ListSoftwareLicenses

0.04    2015-02-04 (PERLANCAR)

	- Ignore failure in instantiating modules like
	  Software::License::CCpack (which is just a main/placeholder
	  module for the Software-License-CCpack distribution of collection
	  of CC licenses) [RT#101885, Thanks Slaven].


0.03     2014-08-16 (SHARYANTO) - Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - [build] CLI scripts are now generated automatically using
           Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ScriptFromFunc. The plugin is still at 0.01 so the
           generated script is not as polished as it should be. Stay tuned.


0.02    2014-06-29 (SHARYANTO)

        - Include license text data (in field 'text').


0.01    2014-06-29 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release.
